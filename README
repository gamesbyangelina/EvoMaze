EvoMaze - A toy computational evolution project, in Java
---

EvoMaze is a tiny Java program (I've committed the full Eclipse project) that evolves 2D mazes using a very basic evolutionary setup. I've commented it here or there but right now it's in a very basic state. I might add to it over time but it's most presented "as-is", for use however you see fit (you don't need attribution, even, though I'd love to know what you use it for so do email me - mike@gamesbyangelina.org)

I use computational evolution in my day-to-way work as a researcher and PhD student. I'm building a system that can design games autonomously called ANGELINA. For more information, go to http://www.gamesbyangelina.org

If you need to ask a question about this code, email mike@gamesbyangelina.org and I'll do my best to answer. Strictly speaking it's not really being "maintained", it's just here in case someone finds it useful.
